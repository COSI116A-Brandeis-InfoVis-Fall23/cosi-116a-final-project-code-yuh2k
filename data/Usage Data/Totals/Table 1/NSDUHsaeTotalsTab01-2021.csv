"NOTE: Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana (including vaping), cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one’s own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes small area estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, 95 percent confidence intervals are based on design-based estimates. Estimated numbers in the “Total U.S.” row are aggregates of estimated numbers across all states.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
