## Data
In this folder you will find all of the data sheets we had planned on using. Although we only ended up using the sheet in the Fatal Data folder and the map json file, we have also included the usage data.

### Fatal Data
This data is complied from the WONDER database and shows the death totals that have an underlying cause of exposure or abuse of substances. The statistics are divided by states and years. The states included are only the New England states. The exact terms of usage can be found [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html), where the CDC provide specfic terms of use concerning the privacy of the individuals.

### Usage Data
This data is gathered from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) survey data. Labeled by their corresponding folders, you will find the data from Table 1 an Table 20, which represent the percentages and totals of illicit drug and pain reliever usages per state, respectively. The data is separated by the files and includes all of the states (including the ones we were not interested in). Each file is separated by age range. Although we didn't use this for our visualization, it provides a useful reference for the population who are at risk.

## 2023.json
This file holds the geographical data we used in generating our map.
