    <h1>Project Team Graduate 5: Opioid Epidemic, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Hang Yu</strong>, <strong>Yuanhuan Deng</strong>, <strong>Sunny Zhou</strong>, <strong>Ye Xu</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em> Fatal Opiate Use Trends in New England 2014 - 2020 </em></p>
    <p><em> Our design is to create an interactive presentation showcasing drug overdose trends from 2014 to 2020 in the New England region.
The focal point of this visualization is a dynamic regional map, providing users with an overview of drug usage patterns. Upon selecting a specific state on the region map, users can delve into detailed year-wise usage statistics through an interactive line chart.
    </em></p>

    <p><b>Click on a state</b> to view its drug overdose mortality rate from 2014 to 2020. The 'crude rate' presented here is calculated as the percentage of drug overdose deaths relative to the total population, multiplied by 100. Specifically, this rate is determined by dividing the number of drug overdose mortalities by the total population of the state, and then multiplying the result by 100 to express it as a per 100 people rate. </p>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Domain Tasks: Data Collection and Analysis; Website Development; Data Visualization; Documentation and Reflection</em></p>
    <p><em>Processes: 1, Team members are assigned specific roles and tasks, such as data gathering, map creation, and webpage enhancement.
2, Team members design and implement specific interactive elements and features for the visualizations.
3, Team members compile and write content for the website, including descriptions and reflective documents.
4, Team members test the website and the visualizations on a local server, refining them based on feedback or observed issues.</em></p>

    <p><em>Abstract Tasks: 1, Data Processing: convert raw data of mortality caused by drug use from each state into a format suitable for visualization and analysis. 2, Interactive Feature Development: develop interactive elements like filtering and linking different visualizations like the maps and the line graph. 3, Content Writing and Editing: write, edit, and format content for the website and documentation. 4 Quality Assurance: test and refine the project components to ensure quality and effectiveness of the visualization and website.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Over the past few weeks, our team has made significant progress on this final project. We've successfully collaborated to aggregate all the necessary data and decided on the most effective visualization methods. Through numerous group meetings and active discussions in Google chat boxes, we've developed our coding approach and effectively coordinated task distribution and descriptions.
  
    As a group, we're pleased with the results we've achieved, recognizing that there's always room for improvement. For instance, we might consider revising the color scheme used in our map for better clarity or impact. Additionally, considering each member's varying schedules, a more balanced distribution of the coding workload could enhance our efficiency and overall output in future projects.</em></p>
